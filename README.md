This is a simple full-stack app. It has a small functional of writing notes on your account profile, but the most interesting part is under the hood.
The registration, autorization and data-exchanging processes are made with today's standarts: encoded and reserved. I learned with practice how to secure data with "bcrypt" and "jsonwebtoken" frameworks, how to store and transfer important information, and how to structure full-stack application.
